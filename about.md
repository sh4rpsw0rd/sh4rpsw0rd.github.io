__Salutations!__

I’m SharpSword, a rider, explorer, and the storyteller behind this blog. Here, you’ll find tales and photos from my journeys through England’s countryside, all from the saddle of Suki, my trusty 2021 Suzuki V-Strom 1050XT.

I started this site to share the joy of discovery, the quirks of solo travel, and the simple pleasures of life on two wheels. Whether you’re a fellow motorcyclist, a lover of the English landscape and folklore, or just curious about the adventures of Suki and me, I hope you’ll find something here that inspires you to chase your own horizons.

__Why “SharpSword”?__

Unlike these insufferable "influencers", I prefer to keep my online identity private. Ergo, you’ll see me by my online alias. It’s about the ride, the road, and the stories; not the spotlight.

__What to expect...__

• Honest ride reports and travel stories

• Local history and folklore

• Motorcycle tips for the everyday adventurer

• Photos and highlights from the road

• Occasional musings on gear, gadgets, and the joy of simple travel

__Thanks for stopping by!__

Feel free to leave a comment (via Nostr), share your own stories, or just enjoy the ride.

Chasing horizons,

SharpSword
