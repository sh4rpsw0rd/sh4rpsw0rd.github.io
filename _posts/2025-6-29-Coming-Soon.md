Salutations!

Whilst I'm planning my next adventure around England's charming countryside, let me introduce you to Suki (yes, I've named my motorcycle).  She's a 2021 Suzuki V-Strom 1050XT and suits me down to the asphalt! Comfortable, loads of torque, and simple.  I'm not one for excessive gadgets.

Anyway, here she is...

Until our first documented ride, stay safe and keep the shiny side up!
